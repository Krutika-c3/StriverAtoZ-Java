/*
 * Space Complexity
 * - memory space required by an algorithm as a function of the input size.
 * * * - Space complexity is the sum of input space and auxiliary space.
 * auxiliary space
 * - additional space used by the algorithm, excluding the input.
 * input space
 * * - space required to store the input data.
 * * - Example: If an algorithm takes an array of size n as input, the input space is O(n).
 * * * - Auxiliary space is the extra space or temporary space used by the algorithm.
 * * * - Example: In a sorting algorithm, the space used for temporary variables or arrays is auxiliary space.
 * 
 * * - Big O (O) notation.
 * * - Focuses on the highest order term, ignoring constants and lower order terms.
